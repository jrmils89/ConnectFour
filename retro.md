### What aspects of your project planning/management do you think you could improve upon?

* Would like to know better how long stuff will take me. Particularly researching new topics (for example the algorithm research).  
* My 'tickets/issues' were a little vague. They were good for myself, but would be hard to follow at times for others. They were not always clear what constituted the completion of the task.

### What area of your code or functionality were you most proud of?
* I'm happy that I got some animations and clean css implemented
* I'm quite happy that I was able to get local storage and a crude algorithm going as well

### What are of your code or functionality was the most difficult to overcome?
* Definitely optimizing the algorithm was tough. I went through a couple iterations of it and never really got it to a place that it both ran quickly or properly weighted the opposite user's potential move well enough.

### If you were to continue working on your project in the future, what aspects would you focus on?
* I'd like to rewrite the AI. I'm happy it kind of works, but there's some significant lacking features there. I think to get it to run better I'd need to re-factor some of the winning conditions as well which would be nice to do anyways (I already refactored it once but there's still work to do there). AI work would definitely be on the top of the list for bigger type wins
* Would fix up some small CSS things that are definitely broken
* New features would be along the line of playing other people
